title: Solition, Breather and Modulation Instability
summary: Nonlinear waves described by nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation.
  * Presented the explicit conditions for the transitions between breathers and solitons with different structures
  * Derived the superregular breather solution that develops from a small localized perturbation, which provide helpful insight on the nonlinear stage of modulation instability of the condensate
