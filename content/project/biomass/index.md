title: Co-pyrolysis of Biomass with polymer wastes
summary: Investigated the interactions among biomass (tobacco stalk) and typical polymers (scrap tire, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) during co-pyrolysis using Thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and Conducted the kinetic analysis to present the main decomposition stage based on first-order reaction model
