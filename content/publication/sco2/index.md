abstract: Allam cycle is a new type of Brayton Cycle that uses supercritical CO2(sCO2)as working medium and is directly heated by combustion of gaseous fuel and pure oxygen. In order to grasp the newest R&D progress on Allam cycle at home and abroad, different issues such as basic principles, economics, properties of cycle fluid, basic combustion characteristics and material corrosion were reviewed in this paper. It is shown that the power efficiency of Allam cycle under working pressure of 30MPa and the turbine inlet temperature of 1100C is 2.3 percentage points higher than the existing F-class gas turbine natural gas combined cycle.
