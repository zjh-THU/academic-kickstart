abstract: Co-pyrolysis of tobacco stalk (TS) with diﬀerent types of polymer wastes such as scrap tire (ST), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated. Thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometer was carried out to examine the thermochemical properties, kinetics, and gas generation. The results of the co-pyrolysis showed a synergistic eﬀect compared to the pyrolysis of the individual components. When using TS/ST co-pyrolysis, the reduction in char residue was about 6% (dry wt. basis) and the increase in organic gases exceeded 20%.
