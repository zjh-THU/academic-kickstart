Zhang is a postgraduate student of Energy Engineering at [Tsinghua University](http://www.te.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html). His research interests include *fuel cells & batteries*, *Fluid Mechanics* and *Nonlinear Dynamics*. His current work focus on how microjets improve combustion stability under flameout limit in combustion chamber and utilizing machine learning to establish the substitution model. 

Previously, he has finished the database and analysis of combustor nozzle test in Chinese Gas Turbine Major Project. During college, he studied nonlinear waves and modulational instability based on nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equations. He specializes in the combination of physical understanding, mathematical modeling and programming to solve physics and engineering problems.

When he was in high school, winterly haze enveloped some cities in China, including his hometown. Under the inspiration from his father, a coal mine engineer, he decided to devote himself to clean energy. On holidays, he went underground in a kilometer-deep mine or climbed to the top of a circulating fluidized bed boiler. During graduate vacations, he investigated the production of batteries in Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, investigated the natgas shortage issue in Hebei province and studied biomass pyrolysis as well as supercritical CO2 cycle.

His dream: a hydrogen powered world, sustainable and pollution-free.
